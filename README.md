# AI Game Generation Platform 

A functional mockup of an AI-powered game creation platform that enables non-technical users to create HTML5 casual games through an intuitive, step-by-step workflow.

## Features

### âœ¨ Complete Game Creation Wizard
- **Template Selection**: Choose from pre-built game templates (Endless Runner, Match Three, Puzzle Platformer, Space Shooter)
- **AI Asset Generation**: Simulate AI-powered asset creation with descriptions
- **Game Mechanics Configuration**: Adjust player movement, physics, and game features
- **Level Design**: Create and manage multiple game levels with difficulty settings
- **Live Game Testing**: Preview and test your game with simulated gameplay
- **Multi-Platform Export**: Export for web, WeChat, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Components
- Step-by-step wizard with progress tracking
- Real-time game preview and testing
- Asset generation simulation with loading states
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Modern, polished UI with smooth animations

### ðŸ›  Technical Implementation
- Built with React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and building
- Component-based architecture following the design document
- Simulated AI services for demonstration purposes
- Mobile-responsive design

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Key Components

### Game Creation Workflow
1. **Template Selection** - Choose from 4 game types with different mechanics
2. **Asset Creation** - Generate sprites, backgrounds, and audio with AI descriptions
3. **Game Mechanics** - Configure movement, physics, and gameplay features
4. **Level Design** - Create multiple levels with varying difficulty
5. **Game Testing** - Live preview with simulated gameplay statistics
6. **Export** - Multi-platform deployment options

### Simulated AI Features
- Asset generation with loading states and preview
- Natural language processing for asset descriptions
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Platform-specific export optimization

## Customization

### Adding New Game Templates
Edit `src/data/templates.ts` to add new game templates:

```typescript
{
  id: 'new-template',
  name: 'New Game Type',
  category: GameCategory.PUZZLE,
  description: 'Description of the new game type',
  preview: 'ðŸŽ¯',
  mechanics: ['Mechanic 1', 'Mechanic 2'],
  requiredAssets: [
    { type: AssetType.SPRITE, name: 'Asset Name', description: 'Asset description' }
  ]
}
```

### Styling
The app uses CSS custom properties and a component-based styling approach. Main styles are in `src/index.css`.

## Architecture Notes

This mockup implements the core interfaces and workflows defined in the design document:

- **GameWizard Interface**: Step-by-step navigation with validation
- **AssetGenerator Interface**: Simulated AI asset generation
- **GameProject Data Model**: Complete project state management
- **Platform Export**: Multi-platform deployment simulation

## Demo Features

- Fully functional wizard navigation
- Simulated AI asset generation with 2-second loading
- Interactive game mechanics configuration
- Visual level design interface
- Live game testing with statistics
- Complete export workflow with shareable links

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real AI services (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
2. **Phaser.js Integration**: Implement actual game engine for live preview
3. **Database**: Add project persistence and user accounts
4. **Real Export**: Implement actual platform-specific builds
5. **Asset Management**: Add real file upload and processing
6. **Collaboration**: Add real-time collaboration features
